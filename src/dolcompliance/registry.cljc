(ns dolcompliance.registry
  "Pure-function filing-draft + filing-submit record construction for
  the USA-DOL (Department of Labor) actor -- an append-only compliance
  book-of-record draft for the single actionable filing track this
  actor manages, `:labor-compliance-package` (the operator's compliance-
  readiness package: SCA/DBRA/PCA labor-standards verification for
  whichever `:contract-category` applies, plus OFCCP Section 503/VEVRAA
  compliance when applicable, bundled as one auditable package -- see
  `dolcompliance.facts` for the underlying regulatory catalog and
  `dolcompliance.governor` for how each dimension independently gates
  `:filing/submit`).

  Like every sibling actor's registry, there is no single reference-
  number standard DOL assigns to a compliance filing-draft/filing-
  submit package this actor produces for its own audit trail -- this
  namespace does NOT invent one; it builds a sequence number and
  validates the record's required fields, the same honest,
  non-fabricating discipline `dolcompliance.facts` uses.

  `engagement-fee-matches-claim?` is an HONEST reapplication of the
  SAME ground-truth-recompute DISCIPLINE sibling actors use (verify a
  claimed monetary total against the entity's own recorded quantity x
  unit fields), reapplied to this repo's own THREE-line revenue model
  (docs/business-model.md Revenue: 'per-engagement compliance-review
  fee' as base-fee + 'recurring regulatory-change monitoring
  subscription' as monthly-rate x monitoring-months + 'compliance-audit
  export package' as an optional flat export-fee, only when the
  engagement actually requested the export package -- an honest
  structural match to the docs' own three revenue lines, not an
  invented pricing scheme).

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to DOL, OFCCP, or SAM.gov. It builds the RECORD an operator
  would keep, not the act of actually filing/registering itself (that
  is `dolcompliance.operation`'s `:filing/submit`, always human-gated
  -- see README Core Contract)."
